## Tai-e Assignments for Static Program Analysis
</div>

### My Solution
This repo is forked from [Tai-e-assignments](https://github.com/pascal-lab/Tai-e-assignments), containing my solution to assignments of the [**Static Program Analysis**](https://tai-e.pascal-lab.net/lectures.html) course by [谭添(Tian Tan)](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/tiantan/index.htm) and [李樾(Yue Li)](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/yueli/index.htm), I referred to [the lecture videos from 2020(in Chinese)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1b7411K7P4) and [the lecture materials](https://tai-e.pascal-lab.net/lectures.html) as I worked on the assignments.

### Getting Started

If you want to do the assignments, please start with "*Overview of Tai-e Assignments*" [[中文](https://tai-e.pascal-lab.net/intro/overview.html)][[English](https://tai-e.pascal-lab.net/en/intro/overview.html)].
